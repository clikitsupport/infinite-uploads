== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I move and share my media library from the cloud? =

Images, videos, and audio files are the biggest performance drain on a website. Hosting your media files alongside your site code both slows performance and quickly creates overages for your more expensive web hosting storage. Moving your Media Library to performance-optimized cloud storage and serving your files from  a Content Delivery Network will not only save space and lower cost, it improves performance.

= Is the Infinite Uploads plugin free? =

Yes. The Infinite Uploads plugin is completely free and can be used on an unlimited number of sites without per-site licensing costs. There is no "Pro" version of the plugin you must buy to access commonly needed features. Pay only for your cloud storage usage.

= Will the Infinite Uploads plugin work without connecting to Cloud Storage? =

Yes. Use the Infinite Uploads storage scanner to analyze the files in your media library. See what files are causing overages with a graphic breakdown of the files size and type and learn what content is causing overages. You will have to connect to our cloud to use the cloud storage and CDN features.

= How many websites can I connect to one cloud account? =

Connect an unlimited number of sites to your Infinite Uploads account at no cost. Pay only for your cloud storage usage.

= How many files can I upload each month? =

Upload as many files as you like and only ever pay for the cost of your storage and bandwidth. No file overages or per-site charges.

= What servers is Infinite Uploads using? =

Infinite Uploads is a hybrid custom stack built and hosted with multiple enterprise-grade cloud services for the ultimate in security, speed, power, and performance. All without the cost of a sysadmin or complexity configuring servers, policies, permissions, keys, etc...pure magic.

= Why can't I just use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, etc? =

There are plugins for that, but they all have expensive per-site or per file annual license fees. And then you have to figure out how to signup for and configure complicated cloud providers and CDNs.
Finally, while the per/GB prices of cloud storage may seem cheap, there are all the hidden costs you don't realize like class A/B/C/D API transaction counts, and bandwidth x3 (to cloud > to cdn > to user). Bandwidth costs alone can often total 8x more than your storage bill!
Infinite Uploads makes the power of the cloud simple and affordable for non-cloud architects like you.
